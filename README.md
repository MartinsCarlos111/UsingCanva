# Development of a Scene with Canva using JavaScript

## Introduction
Canva is a powerful graphic design tool that allows the creation of various visual content intuitively. With the aim of empowering users to fully explore Canva's functionalities, a system has been developed to create a scene using the JavaScript programming language. This enhances my understanding of programming logic while refining my design skills.

## Objective of the System:
The primary purpose of the system was to create a visually pleasing scene using the logics and tools available in Canva.
